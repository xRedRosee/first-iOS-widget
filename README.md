# First iOS widget

A simple prototype for an iOS widget with Swift.

## Website purpose

For our group project, I was responsible for making the iOS widget, but before working this out, I made a simple first widget prototype with a simple setup. This widget has a connection using AppGroups with the Swift App and collects data using UserDefaults.

## Code language

This widget is made using Swift and SwiftUI.

## How does this work?

When opening this code in XCode, you will be able to run it on the emulator.
