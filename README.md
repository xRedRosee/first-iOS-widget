# First iOS widget

A simple prototype for an iOS widget with Swift.

## Project purpose

For our group project, I was responsible for making the iOS widget, but before working this out, I made a simple first widget prototype with a simple setup. This widget has a connection using AppGroups with the Swift App and collects data using UserDefaults, as this was also needed for a later phase in the group project.
This widget and app is made using Swift and SwiftUI.

## How does this work?

When opening this code in XCode, you will be able to run it on the emulator. You can update the values in the app where it then gets realtime updated in the widget on the homescreen.
